# Note that when running pylint too we actually ignore PEP8
# max line length errors (E501) entirely via the command line
# for two reasons:
# 1. Pylint checks for long lines too so PEP8 checks are redundant.
# 2. Pylint is more configurable via disable= comments in the code.
# There's some confusion over whether the limit should be 79 or 80.
#max_line_length = 79

# Suppress "module level import not at top of file" because
# it's too strict. Imports should be near the top but there
# are good reasons not to force them to be *at* the top.
#ignore = E402

# This warning seems impossible to satisfy. I've tried contorting
# the offending code various ways and it just won't shut up.
# I see no problem with "line break after binary operator" anyway.
#ignore = W504
